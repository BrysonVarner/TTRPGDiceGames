# TTRPGDiceGames
A TTRPG Dice Rolling app and Dice gambling game 

This console program started out as a much needed distraction while I was working on a little project.
I have been a Tabletop role-playing gamer since the early 1990s, and this was a fun way I could
use that experience to translate it into some digital fun. I built a simple dice roller first, 
then added a gambling game that I had learned from a quest while playing in one of my group campaigns.

I hope you find it as much fun as I do.
